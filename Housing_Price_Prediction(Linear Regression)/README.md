# Housing_Price_Prediction(Linear Regression)

## Task

- Based on the us_housing.csv data, establish a linear regression model to predict reasonable house prices.  
Use area as the input variable to build a single-factor model, evaluate the model's performance, and visualize the results of the linear evaluation model.  
  
- Use income, housing age, number of rooms, population, and area as input variables to build a multi-factor model and evaluate its performance.  
  
- Predict reasonable house prices with multi-factors.
