# Housing Price Prediction (Linear Regression)

This project demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict housing prices in the United States based on various factors. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to develop accurate models that can forecast house prices using both single and multiple input variables.

## Project Overview

Using the data from `us_housing.csv`, this project involves building linear regression models to predict housing prices. The analysis includes developing a single-factor model using area as the input variable and a multi-factor model using multiple variables such as income, housing age, number of rooms, population, and area.

## Tasks

1. **Single-Factor Linear Regression Model:**
   - Load and clean the dataset from `us_housing.csv`.
   - Develop a linear regression model using area as the input variable.
   - Evaluate the model's performance and visualize the results.

2. **Multi-Factor Linear Regression Model:**
   - Develop a multi-factor linear regression model using income, housing age, number of rooms, population, and area as input variables.
   - Evaluate the performance of the multi-factor model.
   - Predict reasonable house prices using the multi-factor model.

## Solution

The complete analysis, including data preparation, model development, and performance evaluation, is provided in the Jupyter Notebook [us_housing_price_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/steve-yuan-8276/machine_learning/blob/main/Housing_Price_Prediction(Linear%20Regression)/us_housing_price_prediction.ipynb).

## Skills Utilized

- **Machine Learning:** Applied linear regression to predict continuous outcomes.
- **Python:** Utilized Python for data processing, model development, and visualization.
- **Linear Regression:** Implemented both single-factor and multi-factor linear regression models.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Used Scikit-Learn for model development and evaluation.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the application of linear regression in predicting housing prices, demonstrating how machine learning techniques can be used to make accurate predictions based on various factors. By comparing single-factor and multi-factor models, we gain insights into the impact of different variables on housing prices.
